# Student Depression Predictive Model

This data analytics project, completed in a group of 4 data analysts, focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict which students are at risk of experience depression.  

The project was developed in a Jupyter Notebook using a student depression dataset sourced from kaggle.com.  The group chose a **logistic regression model** because it's effective in scenarios with a binary outcome - whether a student is ***depressed or not***.  

The workflow of the project consisted of the following activities: 

- Developing business & analytical objectives
- Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Cleansing & preprocessing data
- Constructing the machine learning model
- Model validation
- Deploying the model to make predictions

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:**  Python
- **Python Libraries:**  Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels, Sklearn 
- **Applications:**  Jupyter Notebook, MS Excel
