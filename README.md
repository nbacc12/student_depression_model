# Student Depression Predictive Model
This data analytics project focuses on developing a machine learning model for predicting students who are at risk of experiencing depression. The model was constructed using the student depression dataset sourced from kaggle.com.  

This was a group project completed in collaboration with 4 data analysts. The project consisted of the following activities:

- Developing business & analytical objectives
- Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Cleansing & preprocessing data
- Constructing the machine learning model
- Model validation
- Deploying the model to make predictions

The group selected a logistic regression model for this project as it's highly applicable to scenarios with binary outcomes (i.e. whether a student is depressed or not).
