# Student Depression Predictive Model

## Executive Summary

This data analytics project, completed in a team of 4, focuses on developing a machine learning model that predicts which students are at risk of experiencing depression.  

Using a student depression dataset sourced from [kaggle.com](http://www.kaggle.com), the team built and validated a **logistic regression model**.  This model was chosen because it's highly effective in scenarios where the outcome is binary.  In this case, a student being ***depressed or not depressed*** would be the possible outcomes.  

The final model was found to be ***approximately 84% accurate*** in predicting a student is at risk of depression.  

## Project Workflow

The analytics workflow of the project was documented in the accompanying Jupyter notebook.  The project consisted of the following activities:

- Developing business & analytical objectives
- Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Cleansing & preprocessing data
- Constructing the machine learning model
- Model validation
- Deploying the model to make predictions

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:**  Python
- **Python Libraries:**  Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels, Sklearn 
- **Applications:**  Jupyter Notebook, MS Excel
